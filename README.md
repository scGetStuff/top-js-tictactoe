The Odin Project, Full Stack JavaScript Path, JavaScript, Organizing your JavaScript Code, Project: Tic Tac Toe


The main goal is to have as little global code as possible; use module and/or factory.

Using Revealing Module pattern.
The page is responsive, at least in the browser tools, for this project I don't care what happens on a phone
No need for user name field, I use left and right mouse for X & O; not concerned with UI, the module code is what matters.
